## 📱 PWA Features

Your app is a Progressive Web App, which means:

## 🗄️ Database

The app uses **IndexedDB** for local storage, so:

## 🛠️ Development Tips

1. **Hot Reload**: Changes to React components will auto-refresh

3. **Mobile Testing**: Use browser dev tools to simulate mobile devices
4. **PWA Testing**: Install the app on your phone for full experience

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
